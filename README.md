# datomic-uniqueness-ftw

This is a Clojure library designed to demonstrate a
confusingly-documented but cool feature of Datomic's tempid
resolution. Maybe we could improve the docs.

## Usage

1. ```(require 'datomic-uniqueness-ftw)```
1. ```(step1)```
1. ```(step2)```
1. ```(step3)```

And then look at the code for ```step3```, in particular.
